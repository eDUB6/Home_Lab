Comprehensive AI-Powered Home Lab Integration Strategy
This document outlines a complete strategy for optimizing and managing your home lab, integrating high-performance enterprise hardware with a sophisticated AI-driven management layer.
1. Hardware Optimization & Redistribution Strategy
1.1. Current Inventory Assessment
Primary Compute (Cisco UCS M220 M4): 2x Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 (44 Cores / 88 Threads), 256GB RAM, 4x 1.6TB Samsung U.2 NVMe.
AI/ML Node (HP ML350 Gen9): 2x Intel Xeon E5-2640 v3 (16 Cores / 32 Threads), 64GB RAM, 2x NVIDIA Tesla P40 GPUs, 1TB WD Blue SN580 NVMe.
Gaming PC: AMD 5800X3D, 32GB RAM, 2x 2TB NVMe.
Dev Machine: AMD 3600X, NVIDIA RTX 2070, 32GB RAM.
Spare CPUs: 2x Intel E5-2650L v3 (12-core, 1.8GHz, 65W TDP).
Network PDU: APC7921 Switched Rack PDU.
Home Automation: Raspberry Pi (HomeSeer HS4), Harmony Hub, Ecobee thermostats.
IoT Devices: 2x robot vacuums, 3D printer, thin clients.
1.2. Optimal Hardware Redistribution Strategy (Recommended)
Configuration A: Maximum Performance is recommended to create specialized, high-performing nodes.
Primary Compute Node (Cisco UCS M220 M4):
Role: Main virtualization host for production VMs and enterprise services.
CPUs: Retain dual E5-2699 v4 (88 threads, 145W each) for maximum processing power.
AI/ML Dedicated Node (HP ML350 Gen9):
Role: Dedicated for AI/ML inference and development workloads.
CPU Upgrade: Replace the 2x E5-2640 v3 with the 2x E5-2650L v3 (12-core, 1.8GHz, 65W each).
RAM Upgrade: Expand to at least 128GB for larger models.
GPUs: Retain 2x Tesla P40 (24GB VRAM each).
Development Workstation (Repurpose AMD 3600X system):
Role: Dedicated, isolated environment for code development, testing, and lightweight AI tasks.
Configuration: AMD 3600X, 32GB RAM, relocated RTX 2070.
Gaming/Workstation (5800X3D system):
Role: Primary gaming and personal workstation.
Configuration: Keep as-is for simplicity.
1.3. Hardware-Specific Configuration Details
Cisco UCS Server:
Management: Use the CIMC's HTML5 interface for KVM and basic management.
Boot: Install Proxmox on a dedicated U.2 NVMe drive. Do not use the SD card slots.
HP ML350 Server:
BIOS Settings: Enable "Above 4G Decoding," set PCIe slots to Gen3 x16, and disable CSM.
Cooling: Mandatory modification. The passively cooled Tesla P40s require active cooling. See the Fan Control Script section for active thermal management.
GPU Passthrough:
# GRUB configuration for IOMMU
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction video=efifb:off"
# Blacklist GPU from host
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1b38" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf


2. Virtualization and Storage Architecture
Hypervisor: Proxmox VE is the optimal choice.
Storage: Use ZFS as the underlying filesystem on each node for data integrity, snapshots, and compression. For a 2-node cluster, GlusterFS can be implemented later for shared storage if needed.
2.1. Optimal U.2 Drive Configuration & Shopping List
This section outlines the ideal end-state storage configuration for both servers, giving you a clear shopping list for your patient deal hunting.
Cisco M220 (Production Server)
You already have the ideal hardware for this server. No new purchases are needed.
System Pool (RAID 1 Mirror):
Drives: 2 x 1.6TB U.2 NVMe
Usable Space: 1.6TB
Purpose: Proxmox OS, critical VMs (like Docker host), and containers. This provides maximum redundancy.
Media Pool (Stripe):
Drives: 2 x 1.6TB U.2 NVMe
Usable Space: 3.2TB
Purpose: Plex/Jellyfin media library where capacity and speed are prioritized over redundancy.
HP ML350 (Dev/AI Server)
This is where your shopping efforts should be focused. The goal is a fully redundant, high-performance, four-drive setup.

Storing large AI models, datasets, test VM disks, and other large files.
Read-Intensive / Capacity: These can be more cost-effective. Since you mostly read AI models after downloading them, endurance is less critical. Look for deals on Samsung PM9A3 or similar capacity-focused enterprise drives.

3. AI/ML Deployment Architecture
3.1. Mixed-GPU Optimization Strategy
Framework: llama.cpp is the best choice for your Pascal-based Tesla P40s.
Optimal Model Distribution:
# Multi-GPU model deployment logic
class MultiGPUInference:
    def __init__(self):
        # Assign large, complex models to the P40s
        self.p40_models = ["llama-2-13b-chat", "codellama-34b"]
        # Assign smaller, faster models to the RTX 2070
        self.rtx2070_models = ["mistral-7b-instruct", "phi-3-mini"]

    def load_balancer(self, request_type):
        if request_type in ["code", "large_context"]:
            return "tesla_p40" # Route to ML350 node
        else:
            return "rtx_2070"  # Route to Dev workstation


Performance Expectations:
Tesla P40: 10-15 tokens/sec for 13B models.
RTX 2070: 25-35 tokens/sec for 7B models.
3.2. Development-to-Production Pipeline
Research & Iteration: Use the RTX 2070 on the dev machine for fast iteration.
Training & Fine-tuning: Leverage the dual Tesla P40s for larger model training.
Inference: Distribute production inference workloads across both GPU nodes.
4. Network and Power Infrastructure
4.1. Power Infrastructure & Management
Total Power Load: Estimated 2,590-3,175W.
UPS: A 5000VA/4000W unit is the minimum requirement.
Cooling: The estimated heat load is ~10,239 BTU/hour. A dedicated mini-split AC system is highly recommended.
APC PDU Optimization: Use the APC7921 for intelligent power management.
4.2. VLAN Segmentation Strategy
VLAN 10 (Management): 10.10.0.0/24
VLAN 20 (Compute): 10.20.0.0/24
VLAN 30 (AI/ML): 10.30.0.0/24
VLAN 40 (IoT): 10.40.0.0/24
5. Security, Monitoring & Automation
Security: Implement a zero-trust model using FreeIPA, 802.1X, and Suricata.
Monitoring: Deploy a comprehensive stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack.
Automation: Use Ansible with modular playbooks stored in Git.
Backup: Employ a 3-2-1 strategy: Proxmox Backup Server (Primary), Borg Backup (File-level), and cloud sync (Offsite).
5.1. HP ML350 Fan Control Script
A critical component of managing the HP ML350 Gen9 with passively cooled Tesla P40 GPUs is active thermal management. A custom bash script has been developed to dynamically control the server's fan speed based on real-time GPU temperatures. The full script is available in a separate document.
6. Core Application Services
This section outlines the key self-hosted services that will form the core of your homelab.
6.1. Project Management: Kanboard
To keep our project on track, we will use Kanboard. It is a free, open-source, and extremely lightweight Kanban board that is perfect for our AIOps plan.
Why Kanboard?
Simple & Focused: It does one thing (Kanban) and does it exceptionally well without unnecessary complexity.
Automation-Friendly: It has an excellent, easy-to-use API that is perfect for being controlled by our future automation scripts (e.g., automatically creating a task when a backup fails).
Lightweight: It has a tiny resource footprint, which is ideal for a homelab environment.
6.2. Self-Hosted Search: SearxNG
SearxNG is the definitive choice for search. It's a private, resource-efficient metasearch engine that integrates natively with OpenWebUI for RAG web search.
6.3. Deployment and Integration with OpenWebUI
The following docker-compose.yml provides a complete stack for running OpenWebUI with Ollama and SearxNG-powered web search.

7. Home Automation Integration
Use HomeSeer HS4 as the central hub, with MQTT as the standardized communication protocol.
8. Phased Implementation Roadmap & Immediate Action Plan
This plan focuses on simple, powerful, and free open-source tools to build a solid foundation.
Step 1: Plan & Procure Future Hardware
This step can be done in parallel with the others. Patiently shopping for used enterprise gear is key to managing costs.
Action: Begin searching for the U.2 drives needed for the optimal ML350 configuration as detailed in Section 2.1.
System Pool Drives: Look for deals on 2x ~2TB high-endurance U.2 drives (e.g., Intel P4610, Samsung PM983).
AI/Data Pool Drives: Look for deals on 2x 4TB-8TB capacity-focused U.2 drives (e.g., Samsung PM9A3).
Step 2: Backup Current Production System (M220 Server)
This is the most critical first step. We do not touch any hardware until we have a complete, verified backup.
Tool: Proxmox Backup Server (PBS).
Action:
Install PBS as a Virtual Machine on the HP ML350 server.
Configure a datastore within PBS using a large drive on the ML350.
From your M220 Proxmox UI, add the new PBS instance as a storage target.
Create and run a backup job for all VMs and containers on the M220. Verify completion.
Step 3: Implement Cooling & Hardware Redistribution
Once the backup is secure, we can safely proceed with hardware changes.
Action (HP ML350):
Prioritize Cooling: Shut down the ML350. Physically install fans to provide direct airflow over the Tesla P40 GPUs.
Perform CPU Swap: While the server is open, swap the existing CPUs with the new E5-2650L v3 CPUs.
Validate: Power on, check BIOS for new CPUs and all RAM, and boot into the OS.
Step 4: Establish the New Development Environment
The goal is to create a clean, codified blueprint for your entire setup.
Action:
Install a fresh instance of Proxmox VE on the ML350's NVMe drive.
Configure basic network settings. This server is now your "Dev/Staging" environment.
Step 5: Document as You Go with Git
Start the habit of "Infrastructure as Code" now.
Tool: Git. Host your own with Gitea or use a free private repository on GitHub/GitLab.
Action:
Create a new repository named homelab-config.
As you configure services, save those configuration files into this repository.
Add a simple README.md file describing the purpose of each configuration.
